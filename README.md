# GameDesignFinal

Game with audio analysis of a file.

According to the analysis in the game we will have three shooters

one that reacts to the piano sound and creates a green line that crosses the platform to kill you

other that follows your position and shoots according to the bass beat

the last one reacts throwing big bullets to the rythm of the drum beat (a delay was actually set higher to allow playability, since the drum beat happens all the time)

the player can move and jump.
